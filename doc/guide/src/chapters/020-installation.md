# Installation

## Requirements
Sham requires a JVM equivalent to JDK version 1.5 or above.

## Download

The Sham distribution, containing the built jar file, source code, Javadoc
and user guide may be downloaded from www.shamdata.org. The jar file may then
be included manually into your local build or class path.

## Maven
If your build system is Maven or is able to include jars from Maven Central
(e.g. Ivy, Gradle), you can declare Sham as a dependency:

**groupId:** `org.shamdata`

**artifactId:** `sham-core`

**version:** `0.4-SNAPSHOT`
