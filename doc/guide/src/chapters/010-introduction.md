# Introduction

Sham is a Java library for test data generation. It includes a number of built
in data generators for common types of data, and an extension mechanism for
custom data generators to work Sham to generate dummy data in a predictable
fashion.

Sham is designed to be easy to incorporate into existing Java / JVM based
projects, and also includes a Grails plugin for ease of use. Contributions
plugging Sham in to other frameworks are welcome.

See [www.shamdata.org](http://www.shamdata.org) for more details on the
motivation for Sham and examples.
